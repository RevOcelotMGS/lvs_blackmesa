	ENT.EngineTorque -- to change acceleration speed
	ENT.EngineIdleRPM -- optional: only used for rpm gauge. This will NOT change engine sound.
	ENT.EngineMaxRPM -- optional: only used for rpm gauge. This will NOT change engine sound.

	ENT.TransGears -- in a sane range based on maxvelocity. Dont set 10 gears for a car that only does 10kmh this will sound like garbage. Ideally use a total of 3 - 6 gears
